# MusicAppXamarinForms

A music app concept built with Xamarin Forms based on the design [MUSICAPPO by Ismail el Azizi](https://dribbble.com/shots/6426851-MUSICAPPO).

I used this as a fun way to learn more about Xamarin Forms Animations. Tapping the image transitions the page from the album view to the now playing view.

Presently no iOS support (I don't have an mac), though supporting it should be as simple as adding image resources and adjusting some platform specific margins.
