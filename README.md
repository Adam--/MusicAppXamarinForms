# MusicAppXamarinForms

A music app UI concept built with Xamarin Forms based on the design [MUSICAPPO by Ismail el Azizi](https://dribbble.com/shots/6426851-MUSICAPPO).

I used this as a fun way to learn more about Xamarin Forms Animations and how to create a parallax scroll effect. Tapping the image transitions the page from the album view to the now playing view. The play/pause button uses a Lottie animation. Tapping the shuffle button switches between the light and dark themes.

Presently no iOS support (I don't have an mac), though supporting it should be as simple as adding image resources and adjusting some platform specific margins.


## Built with
- [PancakeView](https://github.com/sthewissen/Xamarin.Forms.PancakeView), rounded views and shadows
- [Lottie](https://github.com/martijn00/LottieXamarin), play pause button animation
- [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms)
- [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism), just for fun
